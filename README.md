# ML-Classification
This task contains a dataset with real data from a construction company about
bookings for the purchase of real estate.

The booking may lead to the conclusion of a purchase agreement, or it may be
canceled.
 
To plan its financial performance, the company wants
to predict whether a booking will lead to a contract or not.

Thus, you will have to build a model for binary classification of bookings.
